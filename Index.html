<h3>The Quadrants</h3>

<div id="p1">
<p> The Homestuck term "Quadrants" refers to the type of romance experienced by the web comic's main non-human species, the trolls. This is because, unlike us humans, they have four different types of romantic experiences. Their romance can be viewed as one giant square that's divided in half vertically, and then in half again, horizontally.</p>
</div>
<div id="p2">


<p> Redrom And Blackrom. The first and most important division between the quadrants is between what is known as Redrom and Blackrom. Redrom, or Red Romance, is feelings based off primarily positive emotions, similar to the human concept of love and friendship. </p>
</div>
<div id="p3">
<p> Blackrom, or Black Romance, is the opposite, and based off primarily negative emotions, such as rivalry and competition. </p>
</div>
<div id="p4">
<p>Concupiscent and Conciliatory. The second division is between the concupiscent and conciliatory quadrants. Concupiscent quadrants are the ones that are viewed as more romantic and play a leading role in reproduction, whereas conciliatory quadrants focus on more platonic relationships that have other roles that you'll see later. </p>

<h4>Lord English</h4>

<div id="p5">
<p><strong>Lord English</strong> is an indestructible, all-powerful demon summoned at the end of the universe, although his time travel abilities allow him to appear prior to his actual summoning. Though the demon's true form is an amalgam of various powerful identities, he was originally a cherub, who obtained unlimited power and unconditional immortality by clearing a dead session of the game. As a result, he apparently cannot be destroyed by ordinary means, but only through the exploitation of a number of time-based glitches and loopholes. He is the leader of the Felt on Alternia, and his current appearance resembles that of an adult cherub, sans wings. <em>Vriska Serket</em> describes English as "the big bad", saying "English was the guy who stacked the whole deck against us from the start, rigging shit to go haywire, wiping out our race, blowing up universes, exteriminateting ghosts, slaughtering dark gods, and shattering reality itself." English was the "demon" summoned by the unhackable.~ath file.</p>

<h4>The Felt</h4>
<img Src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mspaintadventures/images/b/b0/Felt.png/revision/latest?cb=20110125230340" alt="The Felt">
<div id="p6">
<p><strong>The Felt</strong> are a gang of time travellers that operate across numerous universes and timelines in the service of their master, Lord English. Their most notable incarnation appears on the planet Alternia, where they are a rival gang to the Midnight Crew. The Felt use a billiards or pool motif to their appearance and character, in contrast with the playing card theme of the Midnight Crew. The standard members of the gang are completely green, besides a brightly-colored hat with number on it corresponding one of the 15 non-cue balls. 8 and below are solid colors, while 9 and up are striped and use white flanks on their hats. Their headquarters on Alternia is an entirely green mansion, and they have at least one other base in a building on the green moon. They  each have different abilities over time, and have a general fixation with clocks and timepieces. There are 17 of them in total (counting Lord English himself).</p>

<li> Doc Scratch is the first guardian of Alternia, and serves as the chief organising force of the Felt in its operations from his residence on the planet's green moon. He is an exceptional character in that he communicates via chat clients with various players, using white text and no screenname, despite his being a first guardian and not a player character or even a parent, guardian or ancestor. Scratch thus defies major conventions of the comic in this capacity, which he further compounds by hijacking the narration towards the end of Act 5 Act 2. In addition to his near-omnipotence as a first guardian, Scratch is also near-omniscient as he features a Magic Cue ball for a head.</li>

<li> 1 - Itchy: Itchy has the ability to slow down time relative to himself, allowing him to act with blinding speed.</li>

<li> 2 - Doze: Doze has the ability to slow down time, but only for himself.</li>
<li> Yeah, I'm not gonna go over all of them so I'm gonna skip to the strongest member (barring Doc Scratch and Lord English).</li>

<li> 15 - Cans: Cans is an enormous brute and the overall biggest and strongest member of the Felt. He has the ability to literally punch (or, rather, "clock") his enemies into next week or even a completly different calender year. </li>
